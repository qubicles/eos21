# EOS21 Protocol ✌🏻☝🏼
Teleport your ERC20 tokens to EOS.

[中文版](README-CH.MD)

## Summary

EOS21 is a protocol to enable cross-chain ⛓ token movement between ETH and EOS.

* ETH (ERC20)  --> EOS21 --> EOS (tokens)

The goal of this protocol is to provide a standard for app developers to move their tokens and apps between chains.

## Built With
* [EOS.IO](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos) - EOS Blockchain
* [EOSIO.CDT](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt) - EOS Contract Development Toolkit

## Prerequisites
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Javascript runtime (tested with v8.10 and 10.11)
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) - Packaging

## EOS21 Overview

We believe that any token should be able to move as the developers desire or require as their apps may be best run on different chains at different times.

Typically, the way this has been done is by using what we call the "snapshot" method. 📸  This method is commonly used by token "airdrops" to send to accounts on ETH or EOS chains that match certain criteria such as having an address with at least X balance of the chain's native token. The EOS native token generation from the ERC20 was a snapshot airdrop. EOS was able to do this by expiring their ERC20 contract thereby making the ERC20 EOS tokens non-fungible.

In the EOS21 protocol, we are providing another option for ERC20 contracts that do not have a built-in pause/expiry function but who want to move their token to another chain. We are calling this action: teleportation. To teleport a token from one chain to another, it will exist on the destination chain, but no longer exist in a fungible form on the source chain.

#### The EOS21 Protocol has 3 Dimensions

* **Dimension 1** is on the source chain, Ethereum. There is a Blackhole 🌌 contract on ETH to perform the absorption of ERC20 tokens and also to receive account information for the destination chain (EOS). This information can either be configured to use the EOS Account name or an EOS Public Key. In the second case, the oracle must be changed to create an EOS account for the user.
* **Dimension 2** is an Oracle 🔮 program that runs off-chain to watch the ETH transactions and authorize the distribution of EOS tokens (in a future version of this protocol, the Oracle could be run entirely on EOS).
* **Dimension 3** is the destination chain, EOS. The EOS token contract which distributes the tokens to the 📩  destination EOS account sent by the token holders in Layer 1.

The standard Blackhole contract has 2 functions - be authorized to receive token Y from Ethereum and then receive the EOS account info the tokens to be distributed on the destination chain via the Oracle.

Once a user sends their tokens and destination account to the Blackhole, the ERC20 tokens will become non-fungible and the EOS tokens will be teleported to their destination account on the EOS chain.

The developer can choose to either send the tokens to a 0X000 address and thereby 🔥 them, or hold them in the Blackhole contract.

# Contributing

Pleaes read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

*EOS21 is open-source and we encourage you to customize, fork, and use the code. We built this as a example case. Some of the ideas we have include:*

* *EOS21 contracts could be modified to power a snapshot distribution using registration of EOS accounts or keys.*
* *EOS21 "teleporter" or "oracle" could be written to run entirely on an EOS chain (instead of node.js) and simplified payment verification (SPV) could be done entirely on-chain.*
* *EOS21 contracts could be modified to burn ETH tokens by sending them to a 0x00 address after the Oracle successfully moves them to EOS.*
* *EOS21 could be modified to allow tokens to travel both ways in the Teleporter ETH ↔ EOS by using a "2-way-peg" of tokens - locking the tokens inside of a contract on each chain.*
* *EOS21 could create public keys on either chain which share the same private key.*
* *EOS21 could be used to authenticate ETH transactions using EOS or vice-versa.*
* *EOS21 can be used to move tokens between EOS sister-chains.*
* *EOS21 BlackHole contract could be rewritten to support other Ethereum forks chains such as GoChain, or other chains that support tokens such as Stellar.*


# End-to-End Testing

*For testing, we will use a local Ethereum chain via Ganache and the EOS Jungle Testnet.*

### Overview for Testing

*Our scripts automate some of this process, but this is to help you understand what each step is in the process.*

1. **Create token on Ethereum.** *Truffle does this. (4 tokens will be notated as 40000 with 4 decimals in Ethereum contract - configure this in the [config.json](https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21/blob/master/config.json)).*
2. **Distribute new tokens to fresh Ethereum account.** *Truffle does this.*
3. **Deploy blackhole contract.** *Contract address will automatically update in the truffle config file).*
4. **Deploy standard eosio.token contract on Jungle Testnet.**
5. **Issue EOS token via eosio.token contract.** *Parameters are configured in [config.json](https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21/blob/master/config.json)*
6. **Start teleport_oracle on node.js server.**
7. **Source Ethereum account must send 2 actions.**
    * Authorize blackhole to teleport an amount of ERC20 tokens.
    * Send EOS account name to activate teleportation.
8. **Oracle will catch the event on Ethereum and send the tokens to the EOS account specified in step 7.**
9. **Close blackhole.**

### Ganache / Jungle Testing Prerequisites
* [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com) - `npm install -g truffle`
* [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) - One click local Ethereum blockchain  
    * *Ganache should be configured to run locally on port 8545 (you may need to set this port in Ganache preferences or edit [config.json](https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21/blob/master/config.json) to match the port number.)*

### Ganache / Jungle Testing Preparation
* [Create EOS Account on Jungle Testnet. GUI](http://dev.cryptolions.io/#account) *This will be our EOSTokenCreatorAccount.*
* [Use Jungle Testnet Faucet GUI to get EOS into your EOS Account. ](http://dev.cryptolions.io/#faucet)*Jungle Testnet gives you free tokens!*


* **Setup EOS wallet**
    * `cleos wallet create --name "<name of wallet>" --to-console`


* **Import private key for account**
    * `cleos wallet import --private-key <EOS private key>--name "<name of wallet>"`


* **Buy ram to deploy EOS token contract.** *This requires about 300kb of RAM, so 20 EOS should be enough on the testnet. For the mainnet, use [EOS NY's EOS Resource Planner](https://www.eosrp.io/) to estimate pricing*
    * `cleos -u http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888 system buyram <EOSTokenCreatorAccount> <EOSTokenCreatorAccount> "20.0000 EOS"`



## Step 1: Truffle Deployment of Ethereum Contracts (ERC20 token + Blackhole)

* **Clone EOS21 repository**
   * `git clone https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21.git`

* ** Compile the EOS token contract**
   * `cd eosio.token`
   * `mkdir build`
   * `cd build`
   * `cmake .. -DEOSIO_CDT_ROOT=/usr/local/eosio.cdt && make`


* ** Change directories to root of project**
    * `cd ../../`
    

* ** Install npm for project**
    * `npm install`


* ** Install truffle infrastructure **
    * `npm install -g truffle`


* ** Compile blackhole contract**
    * `cd blackhole && truffle compile`


* ** Test all contracts**
    * `truffle test`


* ** Deploy ERC20 contract and the blackhole contract defined in [config.json](https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21/blob/master/config.json)**
    * `truffle migrate --reset --network ganache`
    * *This process will also send your newly created ERC20 tokens to your first account in the Ganache interface.*

## Step 2: Deploy Oracle
* ** Start the oracle from the root of the EOS21 project**
  * *Open another session - or even better [screen](https://www.rackaid.com/blog/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/) the command.*
  * `node ./eos21.js`

## Step 3: Deploy EOS Token Contract
* ** Deploy standard EOSIO.token contract**
  * `cleos -u http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888 set contract <EOSTokenCreatorAccount> ./eosio.token`

* ** Issue custom EOS Token via eosio.token contract** *You may need to unlock wallet first)*
`cleos -u http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888 push action <EOSTokenCreatorAccount> create '["<EOSTokenCreatorAccount>","4.0000 <EOSTokenName>"]' -p <EOSTokenCreatorAccount>@active`

## Step 4: Test Teleportation
* ** Enter ganache console**
  * `truffle console --network ganache`

* ** Get the ERC token contract address**
  * `ERC20Token.deployed().then(i => erc20=i)`
  * *Search in the results of the above command, you will get the public key of the ERC20 token in the "from" field. Take note of this, you will need this in a minute 0x52... will be the ERC20PublicKey we in 2 steps*
  * **ERC20PublicKey Example:**
		class_defaults:
		{ from: '0x52410180254b53a0816e77082ec0578d7a141c5c',


* ** Use Blackhole Contract**
    * `BlackHoleEosAccount.deployed().then(i => blackhole=i)`


* ** Send Approval to Blackhole to Attract Tokens**
    * `erc20.approve(blackhole.address, 40000, {from:'<ERC20PublicKey>'})`
    * *this is the 0x52... address from the example above, your address will be different.*


* ** Teleport tokens by entering destination EOS account**
    * `blackhole.teleport("<DestinationEOSAccount>")`
    *  *You should see the action happen in the console of your oracle!*


* ** Check balance of Custom EOS Tokens in the Destination EOS account**
    *  `cleos -u http://dev.cryptolions.io:38888 get table <EOSTokenCreatorAccount> <DestinationEOSAccount> accounts`

### Your test tokens have been teleported!

#### *We strongly recommend testing first using the Ganache / Jungle Guide outlined above.*

#### Testing Preparation
* You must have ERC20 token deployed on Ethereum mainnet, EOS token deployed on EOS mainnet, and have the keys that have permission to transfer the EOS token loaded in a wallet where the oracle will be running.
* In [config.json](https://github.com/sheos-org/eos21/blob/master/config.json) configure `blackhole` and `eosiotoken` sections to your token parameters.
    * `websocket_provider` will point to Ethereum node - on mainnet use `wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws`
    * `critic_block` will be the Ethereum block number that you want the blackhole contract to expire, set to 0 if it never expires.
    * `decimals` `symbol` and `tokens` will be the number of decimals defined in your ERC20 token contract, the symbol of your ERC20 token, and the maximum amount of tokens in your ERC20 contract.
    * `chain_id` will be the EOS chain ID - for EOS mainnet it will be `aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906`
    * `http_endpoint` points to an EOS API node
    * `account` is the account that has transfer permission of your issued EOS token address
    * `private_key` private key that can has permission to transfer the EOS token
* Install `eos21/blackhole/contracts/BlackHoleEosAccount.sol` or `blackhole/contracts/BlackHoleEosPublicKey.sol` on Ethereum mainnet
* Start the Oracle 🔮 eos21/oracle/TeleportOracle.js
* From an Ethereum account containing tokens you want to teleport, authorize the blackhole to attract tokens from your account, then send your EOS account name to the contract "teleport" action to initiate the movement of tokens to EOS. *This process could be made really simple through very good UX/UI design for an interface.*
